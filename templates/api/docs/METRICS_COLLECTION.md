```

## Available Data Types

### Standard Metrics

- **count**: Total count of records
- **sum**: Sum of numeric fields (amount, quantity, total, price)
- **average**: Average of numeric fields
- **min**: Minimum values of fields
- **max**: Maximum values of fields
- **byStatus**: Group count by status field
- **stockStatus**: Stock levels (inStock, lowStock, outOfStock) - for products
- **resolved**: Resolved vs unresolved count - for alerts

### Time-Based Metrics (Custom)

You can use custom metric names that include time periods:

**Current Period Metrics:**

- **today[ModelName]**: Count of records created today (since midnight)
- **thisWeek[ModelName]**: Count of records created this week (since Monday)
- **thisMonth[ModelName]**: Count of records created this month (since 1st)
- **thisQuarter[ModelName]**: Count of records created this quarter (Q1: Jan-Mar, Q2: Apr-Jun, Q3: Jul-Sep, Q4: Oct-Dec)
- **thisYear[ModelName]**: Count of records created this year (since January 1st)

**Rolling Period Metrics (Last N Days):**

- **weekly[ModelName]**: Count of records from the last 7 days
- **monthly[ModelName]**: Count of records from the last 30 days
- **annual[ModelName]**: Count of records from the last 365 days

Examples: `todayProducts`, `thisWeekUsers`, `thisMonthOrders`, `thisQuarterSales`, `weeklyProducts`, `monthlyTransactions`

### Field-Based Grouping

Any field name can be used as a data type to group by that field.

```

## Filtering Options

### Date Filters

- **dateFrom**: Date string (YYYY-MM-DD) - Start date for filtering records
- **dateTo**: Date string (YYYY-MM-DD) - End date for filtering records

These filters apply to the `createdAt` field of the model.

### Common Model Filters

You can include any model-specific filter in the filter object:

- **isActive**: Boolean - Filter by active status
- **status**: String - Filter by status field
- Any other field on the model

**Note**: `isDeleted: false` is automatically applied to all queries.

### Example with Multiple Filters

```json
{
	"model": "User",
	"data": ["count", "stockStatus"],
	"filter": {
		"dateFrom": "2025-01-01",
		"dateTo": "2025-12-31",
		"isActive": true
	}
}
```

## Error Handling

### Model Not Found Error

```json
{
	"success": false,
	"message": "Failed to collect metrics: Model \"InvalidModel\" not found",
	"statusCode": 400
}
```

### Validation Error

```json
{
	"success": false,
	"message": "Validation failed",
	"statusCode": 400,
	"errors": {
		"model": ["Model name is required"],
		"data": ["At least one data type is required"]
	}
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Time-Based Entity Tracking**: Track weekly, monthly, and annual counts
2. **Dashboard Widgets**: Generate single-model metrics for dashboard cards
3. **Status Monitoring**: Monitor record status distributions
4. **User Activity**: Track user counts and status distributions
5. **Alert Management**: Monitor resolved vs unresolved alerts
6. **Aggregate Analytics**: Aggregate amounts and counts
7. **Filtered Reports**: Generate reports with specific date ranges and filters

## Notes

- **Model names are case-insensitive**: "User", "user", and "USER" all work
- **Automatic filtering**: All queries automatically exclude deleted records (`isDeleted: false`)
- **Date filtering**: Uses the `createdAt` field by default
- **Flexible data types**:
    - Standard types: count, sum, average, min, max, byStatus, stockStatus, resolved
    - Time-based: Any metric name containing "weekly", "monthly", or "annual"
    - Field-based: Any model field name can be used for grouping
- **Numeric aggregations**: Sum, average, min, and max operations work on common numeric fields (amount, quantity, total, price)
- **Graceful handling**: If a field doesn't exist on a model, it will be silently skipped
- **One model per request**: Each request collects metrics from a single model

## Time-Based Metrics Calculation

### Current Period Metrics

Calculate counts for the current time period:

- **Today**: Records created today (from 00:00:00 to now)
- **This Week**: Records created this week (from Monday 00:00:00 to now)
- **This Month**: Records created this month (from 1st 00:00:00 to now)
- **This Quarter**: Records created this quarter
    - Q1: January 1 - March 31
    - Q2: April 1 - June 30
    - Q3: July 1 - September 30
    - Q4: October 1 - December 31
- **This Year**: Records created this year (from January 1 00:00:00 to now)

### Rolling Period Metrics (Last N Days)

Calculate counts for the last N days from now:

- **Weekly**: Records created in the last 7 days from now
- **Monthly**: Records created in the last 30 days from now
- **Annual**: Records created in the last 365 days from now

**Note**: Time-based metrics are independent of the `dateFrom` and `dateTo` filters, which apply to all other metric types.
